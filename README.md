### Project Title
Bike Share Analysis

### Description
This program analyzes bike share data from Chicago, New York and Washington.
The user indicates what city, month and day of the week they would like to see
results for. Once the stats are shown, the user has the option to see the DataFrames 5 at a time until they decide to stop. The application will then ask if it should be reset or not. If it is reset, the user will be brought back to the first prompt.

### Files used
